# Sample Exercise

### Write a program that computes the monthly tax amount of employees in a factory. If the monthly income of any employee is less than 1000 TL, s/he will not pay any tax. If the income is greater than or equal to 1000 TL and less than 3000 TL, the tax amount will be 10% of the montly income. If the monthly income is greater than or equal to 3000 TL, s/he will pay 15% of the income as tax. The input/output format is given below.

**_Ouput should be printed with 2 digit precision after the decimal point (See Hint below)._**
